<h3> Introduction </h3>

  <p>Hi, my name is Anup! I graduated as a biomedical engineering student, and now work in software engineering.</p>

<h3> Web Development Experience </h3>
<p>
  Last semester I took CSCI-171 Data Visualization, which took me through how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  The class also showed me how to use frameworks like Bootstrap. The primary focus was D3.js. In my career I work on a data
  portal project that uses Vue.js, but am not the sole owner of that project.
</p>


<h3> Software Development Experience </h3>
<p>
  I have been working in software development for 5-6 years now. I have built python packages, data pipelines using AWS, and more recently a
  data portal! My interests are still full-stack at this point in my career.

</p>



<h3> My Interest in this Course </h3>

  <p>
    This class is a part of my interest in learning more front-end development. Also I have a passion for UI and UX. Things like how to dynamically
    load content in to subsections of pages without doing a full page refresh are extremely interesting to me. My experience in HTML and CSS has not
    shown me how to do this.

  </p>
<h3> Favorite Restaurant </h3>
  <p>
    French Bistro in South End, Boston. Phenomenal french cooking technique!
