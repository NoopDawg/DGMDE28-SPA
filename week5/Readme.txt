Question:
What are a) the most interesting and b) the most surprising Javascript constructs we
have learned in the past few weeks.

Answer:
a) Most Interesting has been the placement of script tags within the HTML document, and using document.write() instead of
selecting and appending content.
b) Most surprising has been the associative arrays, as I have always thought you would just use JSON instead.
